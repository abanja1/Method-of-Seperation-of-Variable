We try to solve the Van Der Pol Equation using the method of seperation of variable. This method used the idea that the second order problem is first split in two first order problem and solve each problem freezing the other variable (method of seperation of variable). We then combine each solution using Lie-Trotter, Strang or other higher order method and compare the solution against the well known Range-Kutta method.
